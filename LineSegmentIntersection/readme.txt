This repository implements the line segment intersection algorithm by line sweep approach and with the help of balanced binary search tree as a data structure.
Balanced binary search tree is also implemented as part of the code.
write command in console for compiling
"gcc -o linesegment.out linesegment.c -std=gnu99 -lm"

then run the code by

"./linesegment.out"

//on screen
enter the no of lines..
give a int  no
it will randomly generate the same no of coordinates for the line segment
